                <p>
                    Since the year of 2020, during the pandemic and my 3rd year in junior high school, I have been a hobbyist game developer and pixel artist making games and artworks in the Philippines.
                    <br>
                    After discovering pixel art, I started as a freelance pixel artist since 2021 up until 2024. 
                    <br>
                    As 2024 approached the year end, I then became a full-time Game Artist at Bitrograde under Mastiff LLC, also known as Mastiff Systems.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    When I started making games, these were usually for game hackathons known as game jams. 
                    <br>
                    I've made over 10 games that were made during a span of 48 hours up until a week depending on the jam's timeframe.
                    <br>
                    These also include a few capstone projects I made for school.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside my game projects, I was also creating pixel artworks to further hone my art skills in the pixel art style.
                    <br>
                    I started from making small game mockups and sprites, to full scenes or character portraits.
